# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for 2020 I'm starting them in Clojure, but there may be some Python and Java solutions as well

Currently this isn't set up to run the solutions outside of a REPL, so I'd recommend using [leiningen](leiningen.org) to install any necessary dependencies, and start up a repl with `lein repl`.

Check out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) for your self, it's 25 days of problems for you to solve. I had fun with it, made it through more problems this year than last. They're available year-round, so I might do some of them again, but for now I'm not working on them.
